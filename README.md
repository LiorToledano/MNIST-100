# MNIST-100
* In this project we loaded mnist data set of hand written digits and built a new data set that based on 3 digit for each image.
* Next we build a class that passes randomly different augmentations for images.
* Afterwards, we did some basic training on the MNIST 100 data set and achieved 95% accuracy on the test set.
